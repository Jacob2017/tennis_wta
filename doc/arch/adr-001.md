# ADR-1: Creating Historial Elo Ratings
## Context
Using Jeff Sackman's record of historical tennis matches, I would like to create my own Elo rankings that I can then use to predict the outcome of tennis matches. 

The north star view is to have:
1. A system that can generate an Elo rating for a player with an arbitrary lookback between 3-36 months. A set of these ratings could then be used as features in a ML model to predict the outcome of a given match.
2. Separate ratings for hard, clay and grass/carpet matches to account for particular players' aptitude on certain surfaces.

The output should be a database that has at least:
1. date - the Monday of each week that represents the week each ranking applies for
2. rank - a simple way to understand where players rank on the default Elo rating - 12 months, all surfaces
3. player - name and id to allow unique identification 
4. ratings - 3m/6m/12m/18m/24m/30m/36m ratings for overall/hard/clay/grass (no 3m or 6m for grass) = 26 columns
5. Nm - number of matches contributing to each rating = 26 columns

This database would then be accessible by a web app for visualisation purposes.
